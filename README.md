# Password-Generator

## Description
A simple password generator that can create both passwords and passphrases.
The generator allows for custom attributes; Special characters, numbers, length of password (password only).

The passphrase will automatically generate two words (seperated by dashes) with a 2 digit number on the end (this is the standard for my workplace).

The app automatically copies to keyboard as soon as the "generate" button is pressed.

(Soon to be made into its own downloadable app)

## Installation

2. Open visual studio code (or another IDE) and run the password_creator.py
