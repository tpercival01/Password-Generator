# Password-Generator

## Description
A simple password generator that can create both passwords and passphrases.
The generator allows for custom attributes; Special characters, numbers, length of password (password only).

The passphrase will automatically generate two words (seperated by dashes) with a 2 digit number on the end (this is the standard for my workplace).

The app automatically copies to keyboard as soon as the "generate" button is pressed.
